This document describes important information about proyect's architecture

root directory possesses different .cjs files, these ones are for testing purposes, they define different environments for testings to work.



src possesses multiple folders and files.


index.js: this files is used as a common import point, it imports all components and functions required for the app to work.

components: this directory uses atomic metodology to divide components based on its utility
  atoms: smaller components who are commonly used for specific purposes
  molecules: a group of atoms that display a better designed component for specific purposes
  organisms: a group of molecules that create a component with a very specific functionality
    forms: pop-up windows used by the user to input data
    graphs: graphs used to visually display data to the user
    sidebar: components related to page navigation bar
    tables: tables used to display data fetched from the database
    templates: base templates used to render page content

context: this dir stores component used to authenticate user sessions

hooks: this dir stores routing protection to redirect not logged in users to login

pages: main page components to render pages, they heavily based and rely on src/components/organisms/templates/

routers: this dir contains routing component used to display diferent pages

store: this dir contains all functions imported by components who perform API requests.
       it heavily relies on src/supabase/ which are the actual API functions

styles: this dit contains CSS, media files (images) and device resolutions used across all proyect

supabase: this dir contains all CRUD functions used to connect with the database.
          although none of this functions is directly used by the components, they need to be called from src/store/

tests: dir that contains all testing scrips and results
  group-test: group testings made with puppeteer
  results: results of testings (you need to run testings to see content here)
  unit-test: unit testing scripts made with jest

utils: common js pure functions or enum data used by components
